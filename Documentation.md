## Overview:
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on setting up, configuring, and using the automated pull request (PR) deployment system using Docker and a GitHub Bot. It covers the prerequisites, setup instructions, detailed usage guidelines, troubleshooting steps, and best practices to ensure smooth operation and easy adoption by other developers and teams.

## Prerequisites:
Before the setup, docker must be installed and running on the local machine or server and the GitHub account to be used must have the necessary permissions to create and manage GitHub Apps.

## Setup Instructions:
Step 1: Repository Setup
Clone the Repository of the GitHub account:
git clone https://github.com/rotimiAbiola/flask-example.git
cd flask-example
Build the Docker Image:
Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project directory, then build the Docker image:
docker build -t "myapp"

Step 2: GitHub App Configuration
To ceate a GitHub App, navigate to GitHub Developer Settings and create a new GitHub App.
Set the GitHub App name, description, and homepage URL.
Configure Permissions:
Navigate to "Permissions & Events" and configure the following permissions:
Repository: Read & Write
Pull Requests: Read & Write
Commit Status: Read & Write
Subscribe to the following events:
Pull request
Push
Generate Private Key:
Generate a private key for the GitHub App and download it. Note the App ID, Client ID, and Client Secret for authentication.

Step 3: GitHub Bot Setup
Develop the GitHub Bot:
Use a framework like Probot (JavaScript/TypeScript) or PyGitHub (Python) to create the GitHub bot.
The bot should be able to interact with the GitHub API to manage PRs and deployments.
Deploy the Bot:
Deploy the bot on a cloud platform or server. Ensure it has access to the GitHub App credentials and can interact with Docker.

## Usage Guide:
Deploying a Pull Request:
Open a Pull Request
Create a new branch and push your changes to GitHub.
Open a pull request (PR) from the new branch to the main branch.

Monitor Deployment Status:
The GitHub bot will automatically comment on the PR with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.
Subsequent commits to the PR branch will trigger updates to the deployment.

Closing a Pull Request:
Once the PR is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch or close it if no longer needed.

Clean Up Deployment:
The GitHub bot will automatically clean up the Docker container associated with the PR, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

## Troubleshooting: 

If docker container fails to start, ensure the Dockerfile is correctly configured and the image builds without errors. Then, check the container logs for specific error messages.
If GitHub Bot Fails to Comment, verify the bot has the necessary permissions and the correct credentials. Also, check the bot's logs for errors related to GitHub API interactions.

## Best Practices:
1. Security:
Secure your Docker environment and GitHub bot to prevent unauthorized access.
Regularly update dependencies and security patches for both Docker and the GitHub bot.
2. Scalability:
Ensure your cloud infrastructure can handle multiple concurrent Docker containers.
Monitor resource usage and scale up as needed.
3. Documentation:
The documentation should be up-to-date with any changes to the deployment system.
A clear contact point for support and further assistance must be provided.
